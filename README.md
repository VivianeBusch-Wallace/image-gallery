# image-gallery

##What it's for
This image gallery is a practice for utilizing CSS code.
I am just showing one example of how an image gallery could be displayed on a website.

When you open the page you will find that the pictures change when the cursor hovers over them.

##CSS used
Mainly I used the following code elements.

For sizing the images:
max-height, max-width

For borders and outlines:
border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left, outline

For positioning the images:
position, z-index, transform, top, left

Extra features for the images:
box-shadow, opacity, filter, (style changes on hover)

Text styling:
text-align, color, font-size, font-weight, font-family (source: google fonts)
